    "\n",
    "Unlike the input of a fully connected layer, which is $x \\in \\mathbb R^{M\\times C_{in}}$, the dimensionality of an image input is 4D: $x \\in \\mathbb R^{M \\times C_{in} \\times H_{in} \\times W_{in}}$, where $M$ is still the batch size, $C_{in}$ is the number of channels of the input (e.g. 3 for RGB), and $H_{in}$ and $W_{in}$ are the height and width of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight parameter $W$ is also different in a convolutional layer.\n",
    "Unlike the 2-D weight matrix for fully connected layers, the kernel is 4-D with dimensions $W \\in \\mathbb R^{C_{out} \\times C_{in} \\times H_K \\times W_K }$, where $H_K$ and $W_K$ are the kernel height and weight, respectively.\n",
    "A common choice for $H_K$ and $W_K$ is $H_K = W_K = 3$ or $5$, but this tends to vary depending on the architecture.\n",
    "Convolving the input with the kernel and adding a bias then gives an output $y \\in \\mathbb R^{M \\times C_{out} \\times H_{out} \\times W_{out}}$.\n",
    "If we use \"same\" padding and a stride of $1$ in our convolution (more on this later), our output will have the same spatial dimensions as the input: $H_{out}=H_{in}$ and $W_{out}=W_{in}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're having trouble visualizing this operation in 4D, it's easier to think about for a single member of the minibatch, one convolutional kernel at a time. \n",
    "Consider a stack of $C_{out}$ number of kernels, each of which are 3D ($C_{in} \\times H_K \\times W_K $). \n",
    "This 3D volume is then slid across the input (which is also 3D: $C_{in} \\times H_{in} \\times W_{in}$) in the two spatial dimensions (along $H_{in}$ and $W_{in}$). \n",
    "The outputs of the multiplication of the kernel and the input at every location creates a single feature map that is $H_{out} \\times W_{out}$. \n",
    "Stacking the feature maps generated by each kernel gives the 3D output $C_{out} \\times H_{out} \\times W_{out} $.\n",

    "<img src=\"Figures/conv_filters.png\" alt=\"Convolutional filters\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",

    "A few more things to note:\n",
    "- Notice the ordering of the dimensions of the input (batch, channels in, height, width).\n",
    "This is commonly referred to as $NCHW$ ordering.\n",
    "Many other languages and libraries (e.g. MATLAB, TensorFlow, the image example at the beginning of this notebook) instead default to the slightly different $NHWC$ ordering.\n",
    "PyTorch defaults to $NCHW$, as it more efficient computationally, especially with CUDA. \n",
    "- An additional argument for the convolution is the *stride*, which controls the how far we slide the convolutional filter as we move it along the input image. \n",
    "The convolutional operator, from its signal processing roots, by default considers a stride length of 1 in all dimensions, but in some situations we would like to consider strides more than 1 (or even less than 1). \n",
    "More on this later.\n",
    "- In the context of signal processing, convolutions usually result in outputs that are larger than the input size, which results from when the kernel \"hangs off the edge\" of the input on both sides. \n",
    "This might not always be desirable.\n",
    "We can control this by controlling the padding of the input.\n",
    "Typically, we use pad the input to ensure the output has the same spatial dimensions as the input (assuming stride of 1); this makes it easier for us to keep track of what the size of our model is.\n",
